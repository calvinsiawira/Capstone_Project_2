Capstone project 2

## Context and Background
YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. According to Variety magazine, “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes).

For this project, our goal is to gain insights into what are some of the factors or common characteristics in Trending videos? I will be exploring a number of variables: video title, channel name, categories, publish time, views, likes, dislikes, comment counts, tags, and description. At the end of the project, I hope to be able to answer some of these questions, but not limited to:

* How is the distribution of title length in youtube trending videos?
* What are the most common words in trending video titles?
* How many trending videos contain at least 1 capitalized word in their titles? 
* Which youTube channel has the largest number of trending videos?
* Which video category has the largest number of trending videos?
* How is the distribution of views, likes, dislikes, and comment counts?
* When is the most optimal time to publish a video? At what day of the week? At what time of the day?

## Data Description
A public dataset from kaggle called "Trending Youtube Video Statistics" built using YouTube's API Services. I will be using the "USVideos.csv" and "US_category_id.json" files, which containes more than 40,000 observations for trending videos in the United States.
